number of philosophers = forks

I have to receive this : 
    number of philosophers
    time to die : time he has to eat before dying
    time to eat : time he has to take before finishing eating
    time to sleep : time he sleeps
    number of times he has to eat : if he has eaten this number of time, it's a win (can be nor specified)

each one has to be called as philo(1, 2, 3, 4)

I have to tell every change of state and the milisecond it happend:
